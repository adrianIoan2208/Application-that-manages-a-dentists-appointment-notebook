## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Hints

1. The application uses two txt files (Patients.txt and Appointments.txt). At the beginning your files contain only the first ID of the patient/appointment situated on the first line of the text file. Every time you add a patient/appointment the file is updated like this: 
    - the number on the first line will get updated with the next ID
    - on the next line it will appear the patient/appointment you have added.
    
2. When you are situated in the Patients/Appointmens tab you have an option to update a patient/appointment
    - it will be easier for you to click on a patient/appointment and click on the Fill with info button.

## Test

The application passes all the tests and also has all exceptions handled.
