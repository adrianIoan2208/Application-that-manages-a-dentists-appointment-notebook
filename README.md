# Application that manages a dentists appointment notebook

This application was built to increase maneuverability over the appointments and to spend less time adding them in the notebook by hand 

                                                     # DentistAppoitnments

There are two main classes, Patient and Appointment. 
Class Patient manages patients instances so that you can watch/add/update/delete the name, age and other attributes related to different patients.
Class Appointment manages the appointments made by different patients in order for you (as a user) to be able to watch/add/update/delete different persons inside the notebook, to set the day/hour of any persons appointment. (Exception handled: there can not be two appointments in the same hour at the same doctor)
